## 🔄 **SWITCHING SIMULATORS**

### **To Use a Different Simulator**:

```bash
# 1. List available simulators
flutter devices

# 2. Run on specific simulator
flutter run -d <device-id>

# Examples:
flutter run -d "iPhone 17 Pro"
flutter run -d "iPad Pro 13-inch"
```

## 🐛 **IF BUILD FAILS**

### **Common Issues**:

**1. Pod Install Error**:
```bash
cd ios
pod deintegrate
pod install
cd ..
flutter run
```

**2. Build Error**:
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

**3. Simulator Not Responding**:
```bash
# Quit simulator
killall Simulator

# Restart
open -a Simulator
flutter run
```

## 📱 **TESTING ON REAL iPhone** (Later)

### **Requirements**:
1. iPhone connected via USB
2. Developer Mode enabled on iPhone
3. Trust computer on iPhone

### **Steps**:
```bash
