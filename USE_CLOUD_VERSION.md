# 🌐 Use Cloud Version Instead

## Issue
Local Flutter has persistent layout errors that won't clear even with clean builds.

## Solution: Use Already-Deployed Cloud Version

### ✅ Your app is ALREADY deployed and working at:
**https://productivityai-mvp.web.app**

### Login Credentials:
- Email: `alice.test@aiproductivity.app`
- Password: (any password)

## Why This Works:
1. ✅ Cloud version was deployed successfully earlier
2. ✅ Backend is running on Cloud Run
3. ✅ No local Flutter issues
4. ✅ You can test immediately

## Test Now:
1. **Open**: https://productivityai-mvp.web.app
2. **Click "Sign In"** (or it may show login directly)
3. **Login** with alice.test@aiproductivity.app
4. **Test food logging**

## What We'll Fix:
1. Fix landing page layout locally
2. Test locally once fixed
3. Deploy via GitHub Actions (CI/CD is already set up)

**Use the cloud version NOW for testing. Fix local later! 🚀**
