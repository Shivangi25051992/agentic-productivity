# 🎉 Fresh Start Complete!

## What I Just Did

### 1. ✅ Killed All Processes
- Stopped Flutter app
- Stopped backend server
- Cleared all running processes

### 2. ✅ Cleared Flutter Cache
- Ran `flutter clean`
- Deleted `.dart_tool/`
- Deleted `build/`
- Deleted iOS Pods and frameworks
- Removed all build artifacts

### 3. ✅ Cleared Backend Cache
- Deleted all `__pycache__` directories
- Removed all `.pyc` files
- Cleared old log files

### 4. ✅ Started Backend Fresh
- Backend running on: `http://192.168.0.115:8000`
- Process ID: 97651
- Status: **HEALTHY** ✅
- Logs: `backend.log`

### 5. ✅ Rebuilt Flutter App
- Fresh dependency resolution
- Clean iOS build starting now

## Current Status

🟢 **Backend**: Running and healthy  
🔄 **iOS App**: Building (will take ~2-3 minutes)

## What to Expect

Once the iOS app finishes building and launches:

1. **Login** with kiki@kiki.com
2. **Navigate to Profile tab**
3. **Profile should load** - backend is confirmed working and returning profile data
4. **If still showing "No Profile Yet"**, tap "Retry Fetch" and check the debug info

## Backend Confirmed Working

The backend successfully:
- ✅ Responds to health checks
- ✅ Has Google Cloud credentials
- ✅ Has `.env` file with all settings
- ✅ Returns profile data (tested with your previous requests)

## Next Steps

Wait for the iOS app to finish building (~2-3 minutes), then test the profile screen!
