## 📍 URLs to Test

### ✅ Backend (Working Now!)
**URL:** http://localhost:8000/health

Test it:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

---

### ⏳ Frontend (Building... ~2-3 minutes)
**URL:** http://localhost:8080

**Status:** Flutter is compiling the new dashboard. This takes time.

---

## 🔐 Login Credentials

Once http://localhost:8080 is ready, use:

**Email:** `alice.test@aiproductivity.app`  
**Password:** `TestPass123!`

---

## ⏰ Timeline

- **Backend:** ✅ Running on port 8000
- **Frontend:** ⏳ Building (started ~3 minutes ago)
- **Expected:** Should be ready in 1-2 more minutes

---

## 🐛 If Still Not Working After 5 Minutes

Flutter might have failed. Try manual start:

```bash
# Open a NEW terminal window
cd /Users/pchintanwar/Documents/Projects-AIProductivity/agentic-productivity/flutter_app

flutter run -d web-server --web-port 8080 --web-hostname 0.0.0.0
```

Wait for: `"Serving web on http://localhost:8080"`

Then go to: http://localhost:8080

## ✅ What's Fixed (Ready to Test)

1. **620 kcal bug** - Backend returns correct calories
2. **Overlapping text** - Fixed padding
3. **Ring overlap** - Added auto-scaling
4. **New dashboard** - Card-based mobile design
